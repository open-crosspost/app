# everything-dev

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 5524246: Refactor CLI and plugin orchestration: remove standalone `packages/cli`, absorb its responsibilities into `everything-dev`, restructure the BOS plugin and contract generation pipeline, overhaul the API registry, and update the plugin build system with a new rspack config format and data-URI fix.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [5524246]
  - every-plugin@2.0.0

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 1cea1e1: Fix mixed content errors when behind reverse proxy (Railway, etc.)

  Added support for `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host` headers to correctly determine the request URL when the server is behind a reverse proxy. This fixes mixed content errors where HTTPS pages were making HTTP API requests.

  Also added `secureHeaders` middleware for additional security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.).
