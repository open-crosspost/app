## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 1cea1e1: Fix mixed content errors when behind reverse proxy (Railway, etc.)

  Added support for `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host` headers to correctly determine the request URL when the server is behind a reverse proxy. This fixes mixed content errors where HTTPS pages were making HTTP API requests.

  Also added `secureHeaders` middleware for additional security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.).
